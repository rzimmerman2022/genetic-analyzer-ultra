Research & educational use only – not medical advice. This analysis is based on current scientific understanding, which is constantly evolving. Genetic predispositions do not determine health outcomes, as environmental and lifestyle factors play significant roles.

Findings related to rare diseases or carrier status should be confirmed by clinical-grade genetic testing in a certified laboratory. 
Consult with a healthcare provider or genetic counselor to understand the implications of any such findings for yourself and your family members.

Pharmacogenomic information can help predict how you might respond to certain medications. However, these are predictions, and actual drug response can be influenced by many other factors including other medications, diet, age, and overall health. 
Always discuss medication decisions with your healthcare provider. Do not change or stop any medication based solely on this genetic report.

SECTION 1: ADVANCED GENETIC STATISTICS
================================================================================

Total Variants Analyzed: 626,906
Call Rate: 97.42%
Homozygous Variants: 504,736
Heterozygous Variants: 99,456
Heterozygosity Rate: 16.46%

SECTION 4: POLYGENIC RISK SCORES
================================================================================
Research & educational use only – not medical advice. This analysis is based on current scientific understanding, which is constantly evolving. Genetic predispositions do not determine health outcomes, as environmental and lifestyle factors play significant roles.

Psychological trait predictions (including cognitive abilities, personality, etc.) are based on statistical associations found in large population studies. These genetic scores typically explain a small fraction of the variance in these complex traits (often <15%). 
Environmental factors (e.g., upbringing, education, life experiences, personal choices, socioeconomic status) and gene-environment interactions have a much larger impact. 
These predictions should NOT be used to assess an individual's intelligence, character, potential, or worth. They are not deterministic and have very limited predictive power for any single individual.
