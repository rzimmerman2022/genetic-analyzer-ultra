Environmental factors (e.g., upbringing, education, life experiences, personal choices, socioeconomic status) and gene-environment interactions have a much larger impact. 
These predictions should NOT be used to assess an individual's intelligence, character, potential, or worth. They are not deterministic and have very limited predictive power for any single individual."""

Most large-scale genetic studies to date have predominantly involved participants of European ancestry. Therefore, findings may not generalize well to individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander, or mixed ancestries. 
This is a known limitation in current genomics research, and efforts are underway to improve diversity in genetic studies."""
