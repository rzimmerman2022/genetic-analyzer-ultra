# Genetic Analyzer Ultra

End-to-end genetic analysis pipeline: Ultra-comprehensive genetic data analyzer with five-pillar QA: provenance, validation, CI handling, contextual disclaimers, and version tracking.

Repository URL: https://github.com/rzimmerman2022/genetic-analyzer-ultra

## Features

- Deterministic provenance hashing for reproducibility  
- Literature-based validation harness with direction/conflict checks  
- Graceful handling of missing confidence intervals (CI)  
- Dynamic ancestry-aware disclaimers and caveats  
- Clear semantic version tracking and audit trail  

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/rzimmerman2022/genetic-analyzer-ultra.git`  
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   The `requirements.txt` file pins the versions of core packages such as
   `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`,
   `networkx`, and `requests` to ensure consistent results.
3. Run the tests
   Make sure the packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed **before**
   executing the test suite. This is also what the CI pipeline should do when
   verifying pull requests.
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
4. Run the analysis
   ```bash
   python genetic_analyzer_ultra.py --ancestry AFR path/to/your/raw_data.txt
   ```
