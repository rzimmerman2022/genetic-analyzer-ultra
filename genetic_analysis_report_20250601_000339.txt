EDUCATIONAL NOTES
----------------------------------------
1. Genetic variants are just one factor in health and traits.
2. Environmental factors often play a larger role than genetics.
3. Most traits are polygenic (influenced by many genes).
4. Scientific understanding of genetics continues to evolve.
5. Consider genetic counseling for health-related questions.
